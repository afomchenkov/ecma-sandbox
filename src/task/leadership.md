# 1. Customer Obsession

Principle: Leaders start with the customer and work backward.

## Example 1

    Situation: A client reported that users were struggling to navigate a complex filtering(search) feature on an e-commerce site, leading to frustration and decreased engagement.
    Task: Simplify the filtering process to improve usability and ensure users can find products easily.
    Action: Conducted usability testing, gathered feedback, and iterated on the design. Redesigned the filtering feature to use intuitive tags and progressive filters, and ensured responsiveness for mobile users.
    Result: Improved user satisfaction scores by 25% and increased product filter usage by 40%.

Example 2

    Situation: A new feature needed to be rolled out quickly, but you noticed during development that its design did not align well with accessibility best practices.
    Task: Advocate for accessible design to meet the needs of all users, even with tight deadlines.
    Action: Proposed a quick accessibility audit, adjusted key components (e.g., adding ARIA roles and improving color contrast), and communicated the importance of accessibility to the team.
    Result: Launched an inclusive feature on schedule, receiving positive feedback from customers with disabilities.

# 2. Deliver Results

Principle: Leaders focus on the key inputs and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.

## Example 3

    Situation: The company was preparing for a high-traffic sales event, but performance issues in the frontend UI were causing latency.
    Task: Optimize the website's performance before the sales event to handle peak traffic smoothly.
    Action: Profiled the application, identified bottlenecks, optimized critical rendering paths, and implemented lazy loading for images and assets.
    Result: Reduced page load times by 50%, ensuring a seamless experience for over 1 million visitors during the sales event.

## Example 4

    Situation: A projectâ€™s launch was delayed because the UI integration with a backend API was inconsistent, causing errors.
    Task: Resolve the inconsistencies to meet the upcoming launch deadline.
    Action: Collaborated closely with backend engineers, debugged the integration, and implemented fallback mechanisms to handle unexpected API behavior.
    Result: Delivered the project on time, maintaining high UI reliability, and achieving 99.9% uptime post-launch.

# 3. Ownership

Principle: Leaders act on behalf of the entire company, not just their team.

## Example 5

    Situation: A critical bug in a shared component library disrupted several teams' projects during a key development sprint.
    Task: Take responsibility for resolving the issue, even though it wasn't directly part of your assigned work.
    Action: Investigated the bug, provided a hotfix, and proposed enhancements to prevent similar issues. Documented the changes and communicated them to the affected teams.
    Result: Mitigated the impact within 24 hours, enabling all teams to stay on schedule.

## Example 6

    Situation: A feature you developed received a higher-than-expected volume of support requests due to unclear error messages.
    Task: Improve user error handling to reduce support dependency.
    Action: Updated error messages to provide actionable guidance, added a help link for more details, and created a knowledge base article to address common issues.
    Result: Reduced support tickets related to the feature by 60% in the following quarter.

# 4. Invent and Simplify

Principle: Leaders expect and require innovation and invention and find ways to simplify.

## Example 7

    Situation: The frontend development team was struggling with long build times, which slowed down deployments and testing cycles.
    Task: Streamline the build process to improve efficiency.
    Action: Researched and introduced a modern bundling tool (e.g., Webpack or Vite) to replace the legacy setup. Created optimized configurations, implemented code splitting, and automated caching mechanisms.
    Result: Reduced build times by 40%, enabling faster deployments and higher team productivity.

Example 8

    Situation: A complex checkout flow required multiple steps, leading to high cart abandonment rates.
    Task: Simplify the process to improve the user experience and reduce abandonment.
    Action: Designed and developed a single-page checkout experience, integrated autofill for saved payment methods, and streamlined error handling.
    Result: Decreased cart abandonment by 20% and increased checkout completion rates by 15%.

# 5. Learn and Be Curious

Principle: Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.

Example 9

    Situation: You noticed that your project was heavily reliant on a JavaScript framework (e.g., React), but you lacked expertise in advanced patterns.
    Task: Upskill yourself to contribute more effectively to the team.
    Action: Took a course on advanced React concepts (e.g., hooks, context, and state management libraries), attended workshops, and shared learnings through team sessions.
    Result: Implemented efficient patterns in the next project, reducing state-related bugs and improving maintainability.

Example 10

    Situation: A project required implementing an innovative animation system, but your current knowledge of advanced CSS animations and Web APIs was limited.
    Task: Quickly learn and apply the necessary skills to deliver a visually stunning user experience.
    Action: Studied CSS animation techniques, Web Animations API, and performance optimization strategies. Created prototypes and shared a proof-of-concept.
    Result: Delivered a high-performance animation system praised by stakeholders for enhancing the product's visual appeal.

# 6. Bias for Action

Principle: Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study.

## Example 11

    Situation: While implementing a feature, the team identified a minor, low-risk bug in the production code affecting a subset of users.
    Task: Fix the issue quickly without waiting for a formal approval process.
    Action: Rolled out a small patch and verified the fix with unit tests, QA validation, and live monitoring. Communicated the change to the team.
    Result: Resolved the issue within hours, maintaining user trust and avoiding escalations.

## Example 12

    Situation: During a sprint demo, a stakeholder requested a last-minute UI change for an upcoming release.
    Task: Evaluate the feasibility and implement the change promptly.
    Action: Assessed the impact, made the adjustments within the same day, and validated the changes with the stakeholder.
    Result: Delivered the updated design on time, ensuring stakeholder satisfaction.

# 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

Principle: Leaders continuously raise the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products.

Example 13

    Situation: While reviewing code for a shared UI component, you noticed inconsistent design patterns and accessibility issues.
    Task: Ensure the component adhered to design guidelines and accessibility standards before merging.
    Action: Refactored the component, added proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes, and documented the updated guidelines for future development.
    Result: Improved code quality, ensured WCAG compliance, and set a higher standard for future components.

Example 14

    Situation: A feature was approved with suboptimal visuals due to tight deadlines.
    Task: Advocate for additional polish without delaying the launch.
    Action: Coordinated with the designer to propose quick enhancements, implemented minor but impactful changes, and validated them with the team.
    Result: Launched a refined feature on time, receiving positive feedback from customers and leadership.

# 8. Are Right, A Lot

Principle: Leaders have strong judgment and good instincts.

## Example 15

    Situation: During a sprint planning meeting, a stakeholder suggested a feature implementation that you believed would lead to poor performance.
    Task: Propose an alternative solution based on prior experience.
    Action: Presented data from previous projects, recommended a more scalable solution, and explained its benefits.
    Result: The team adopted your approach, which performed 30% better during testing.

Example 16

    Situation: A team discussion on frontend architecture included a debate on choosing between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR).
    Task: Make the right architectural choice for the project.
    Action: Analyzed the requirements (e.g., SEO and performance needs), shared insights from prior implementations, and recommended SSR for better initial page load speed.
    Result: The decision led to faster load times and improved search engine rankings.
